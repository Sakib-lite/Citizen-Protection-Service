# Citizen-Protection-Service

The goal of this project is to develop a web application for citizens to report problems and incidents in their community. The app allows users to select a location on a map and submit a report, which is then sent to the nearest police station for action. This system aims to improve communication between citizens and law enforcement, allowing for more efficient and effective problem-solving in the community. The project will involve the use of technologies such as web development frameworks and mapping APIs to create the interactive user interface and locate the nearest police station. This allows for a more efficient response time and improved action on resolving the problem. The user-friendly interface and real-time tracking features also allow citizens to stay informed and updated on the status of their report. The Citizen Protection Service Web Application is a valuable tool that empowers citizens to play an active role in maintaining the safety and well-being of their community.
